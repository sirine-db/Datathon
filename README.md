## What is Breast Cancer?

Breast cancer is a disease in which abnormal breast cells grow out of control and form tumours. If left unchecked, the tumours can spread throughout the body and become fatal,
Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for improving survival rates, offering less aggressive treatments, and enhancing the quality of life.

## Role Of Machine Learning In Detection Of Breast Cancer

A mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breast. It can be used to check for breast cancer in women who have no signs or symptoms of the disease. It can also be used if you have a lump or other sign of breast cancer.

Screening mammography is the type of mammogram that checks you when you have no symptoms. It can help reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer among women ages 40 to 70. But it can also have drawbacks. Mammograms can sometimes find something that looks abnormal but isn't cancer. This leads to further testing and can cause you anxiety. 

Now while its difficult to figure out for physicians  by seeing only images of x-ray that weather the tumor is toxic or not training a machine learning model according to the identification of tumour can be of great help.
